The Banking System
We have used the concept of Blowfish Algorithm in a banking system, we created using Python and MySQL. The algorithm encrypts the password entered by the user in the banking system and stores it in a database. 

The main objective of the project is to develop an online Banking system. The current banking system used widely throughout the world requires a lot of manual work such as visiting the bank for depositing or withdrawing money into an account, it is also difficult to find account information about the account holder in the current banking system. While creating a new account the system will check the userâ€™s existence in the database and provide them with an appropriate set of services with respect to the role of the user.

The main purpose of developing our banking system is to design an application for providing a better experience where these tedious processes are automated. In our bank management system the user can check their balance online as well as keeping a record for their daily transactions along with storing important banking details and an interface for retrieving theses details with 100% accuracy.
The main component of our banking system is the protection of the user's account by encrypting their passwords using the Blowfish Algorithm, which decreases the vulnerability of the system against malicious password leaks and frauds.
